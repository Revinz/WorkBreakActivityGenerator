# [Abandoned] Work Break Activity Generator
This extension is similar to that of a Pomodoro technique timer. The addition is that it generates a random one activity from a list of activites, made by the end user, when a break occurs.

**#Learning Purpose:**
Personal project to primarily learn **Unit Testing** as as well improving my JavaScript, HTML/CSS.
The unit testing is made with **Jasmine** as testing framework, **Karma** for running tests in the browser + **sinon-chrome** for mocking Chrome API.

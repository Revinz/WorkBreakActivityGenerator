# (WIP) Work Break Activity Generator
This extension is similar to that of a Pomodoro technique timer. The addition is that it generates a random one activity from a list of activites made by the end user.

**#Status**
The current status is around 60% finished for a 1.0 / MVP release. However, there a bunch of desired features I would like to add after releasing it, such as custom 'cycles' (e.g. 1 pomodoro cycle), custom focus/break durations, custom 'phases' (currently limited to focus, short break and long break) and so on.

**#Learning Purpose:**
Personal project to primarily learn **Unit Testing** as as well improving my JavaScript, HTML/CSS.
The unit testing is made with **Jasmine** as testing framework, **Karma** for running tests in the browser + **sinon-chrome** for mocking Chrome API.

Besides using the above, this project also uses NodeJS and NPM for installing the different packages.
